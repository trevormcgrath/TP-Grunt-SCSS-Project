This is a guide on how to get started learning to write your styles in .scss form instead of .css form.

###First off, why use a CSS Preprocessor, and why use SASS/SCSS?###
In case you haven't noticed, writing CSS can become pretty repetitive. From having to look up hex values for colors, targeting the right elements of your HTML markup, making sure things are responsive... and oh wait what is that? the client decided on a different design comp, and you need to find NEW hex color codes, new fonts, etc. This becomes pretty time consuming.

1. Saves you time
2. Write neater code that has reusable pieces and variables
3. Calculations and logic within your code
4. More organized and easy for others to step into your project
